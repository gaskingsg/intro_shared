					<h3><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong></h3><br> 
					<p><br>Student number: s3882572<br>
My name is Laura Lam and I was born and raised in ‘Four-Seasons-In-One-Day’ Melbourne, Victoria. The only language I speak is English (Currently learning Java if that counts har har). Before my switch to IT, I was a chef and studied a Certificate 3 in Commercial Cookery at William Angliss.<br>

<br>My interest in IT began from when I played video games as a child. I loved the feeling of accomplishment in completing challenges, exploring different worlds and playing with my friends. I decided I wanted to teach myself how to program as well as have a creative outlet, without a cost penalty. I currently don’t have any professional experience within the IT industry, but I am hoping that will change with the completion of a Bachelor of IT.

				<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests</strong></h3><br>
				<br><h4>Myers-Briggs test</h4><br>
The results of the Myers-Briggs test show that I am of the ESFJ personality type, also known as ‘The Caregiver’. The indicates that I am a peoples person, highly supportive of others, have a natural tendency to want to control my environment, and take my responsibilities quite seriously.<br>
<br><h4>Learning Styles test</h4><br>
I learn best through visual means. Some examples include displaying colourful sticky-notes on walls or laptops with rewritten facts, having the TV on whilst studying for better concentration, or using diagrams.<br>
<br><h4>Creativity test</h4><br>
I scored the highest in connection and complexity, which indicates that I can make connections between things wherein the connection is not apparent at first glance and the ability to manage the relationships between vast amounts of information.</p>
