My name is Laura Lam and I was born and raised in ‘Four-Seasons-In-One-Day’ Melbourne, Victoria. The only language I speak is English (Currently learning Java if that counts har har). Before my switch to IT, I was a chef and studied a Certificate 3 in Commercial Cookery at William Angliss.<br>

<br>My interest in IT began from when I played video games as a child. I loved the feeling of accomplishment in completing challenges, exploring different worlds and playing with my friends. I decided I wanted to teach myself how to program as well as have a creative outlet, without a cost penalty. I currently don’t have any professional experience within the IT industry, but I am hoping that will change with the completion of a Bachelor of IT.
