					<p><br>Student Number: s3799302  <br>

			<br> <p> Nationality & Culture: Irish </p>

<p>I am currently studying Bachelor of Business @ Rmit via Open Uni. This is my 8th unit.</p>
</p>Wish I could speak another language, if I could choose one it to wake up and be able to speak it would be Japanese..</p>
<p>Language spoken: English</p>
<p>Interesting fact about me: A hobby of mine is watching my favourite sport, Football (or as Aussies call it, Soccer). This requires you to be awake at all hours of the night to watch EPL games in the UK.</p>
 <br>Iâ€™m undertaking this program to get a start and see if I can get a greater understanding and some extra skills. I also attended a IOT meeting on how the IOT can be used to track waste levels inside bins reducing wasted transport costs and I was hooked in.<br>

<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests</strong></h3><br>

	<br> <h4> Myer Briggs Test> </h4> <br>
	Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) = ESTJ The Coordinators
	<br> <h4> Learning Style Test> </h4> <br>
Learning Style Indicator = Auditory Style
<br> <h4> Personality Self-Test> </h4> <br>
The two results showed that I am confident in my own ability to succeed within my workplace and that I am Achievement driven. I scored 10/10 in the confidence test & 7/10 in the achievement test. Both scores are pretty accurate in how I go about my work and personal life.

<br> TI feel these test results are an accurate representation of my personality.
I feel these results will assist with forming a strong team, with a focus on teamwork and collaboration. Our team has been formed since Week 1 and have been in regular communication to start the ball rolling on out team project.
Taking into account the results, it will be key to good communication, with a open two way dialog between all team members to have successful outcomes. The results describe me very well, but as I do not have a background in IT or Coding, I will be taking the lead from another team member on how we can progress. Also, will be happy to share responsibility on leading meetings and keeping track of projects.
