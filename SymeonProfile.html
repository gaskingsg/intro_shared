					<p><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong>:
					<p>Student number: s3889431</p>
          <p>I am a 21-year-old first year student who completed the year 12 HSC back in 2016. My current
            plans are to go to Western Sydney University to study a Bachelor of Information and Communications
            Technology in early March 2021. My hobbies include playing sports, video games, and socialising
            with my friends whenever possible!</p>
          <p>My interest in IT stems from its exponential growth and importance within the modern world.
            The field of Cybersecurity is interesting to me as privacy and data are more vulnerable now
            than ever and being able to help both individuals and large businesses will provide a sense
            of fulfilment. IT support also stands out as a fulfilling role with being able to troubleshoot
            tech related issues and resolve them for the average computer user.</p>
          <p>I have no formal IT experience or qualifications; however, over the past 6 weeks I have been
            learning to utilise tools such as GitHub and Microsoft Teams, and learning how to write HTML & CSS.
            HTML has been very fun to learn as it provides a rewarding feeling once you see your code turn into
            a tangible webpage. I am willing to push myself and learn about all aspects of the IT field.</p>
          <br><h3><strong>Personality Tests</strong></h3><br>
          <h4>Myers-Briggs test</h4>
          <p>My results indicate that I am a campaigner ENFP-A type. These results suggest that my decisions
            are made mainly on gut feeling and intuition rather than logic and careful thought. This gives me
            a valuable perspective on future decisions as I will likely take a longer pause to think and
            deliberate, as opposed to trusting my heart straight away.</p>
          <h4>Learning Styles test</h4>
          <p>Scoring a 13 for “activist” for the Mumford and Honey LSQ confirms that a hands-on and open-minded
            style of learning is crucial for me to learn effectively and efficiently. This test shows that if
            we are doing something practical such as brainstorming as a group we can gain insight into each other
            and as a team.</p>
          <h4>Big Five Personality test</h4>
          <p>Scoring 83% on the Big Five Personality Test for “agreeableness” also highlights my ability to
            understand and empathise with people regardless of their issue. Even though I may have not been through
            the same experience, it is necessary to remain optimistic and actively listen to the individual.</p>
