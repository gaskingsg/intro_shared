					<h2>My Interest In IT</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Around the time I finished school and entered the workforce, I suddenly developed a keen interest in IT. I was forced to learn the basics of computing and from there my curiosity continued to grow, as did my skill set. To my amazement, I had the ability to pick things up and learn quickly, I soon realised that computers and software were not that difficult to use, this was a real turning point in my developing interest in IT and my education pathway.</p>
				<p>Now I have a strong passion for IT, dedicated over 10years working in the field, and I have operated in many roles where I assist others to develop their skills using different technologies in the educational sector.</p>
				<p>With RMIT&rsquo;s reputation of excellence, subject availability, flexibility and the support available to students &ndash; I knew this was a winning combination for me and I couldn&rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to further my education. By undertaking the unit Introduction to Technology, I hope to gain a broader awareness and a higher level of exposure to different technologies, and hopefully a positive course outcome result.</p>

					<h2>My Ideal Job<br</h2>

					<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51102662?utm_source=joraau&amp;utm_campaign=joraau&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;tracking=ILC-S%2AAU%2A-JOR-Referrer-4324">Learning Technologist</a> <a href="IdealJob.pdf">(Ad)</a>
					<p>The Learning Technologist role at Melbourne Polytechnic is an appealing role to me, the role is in the field of education plus the role is primarily responsible for fostering the learning of cutting edge and innovative technology to a variety of stakeholders (secondary school students, community and industry partners). This role is similar, but of a higher level, to what I have had exposure and experience in.</p>
					<p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for the role, as indicated, include a degree or postgraduate degree or equivalent qualification, high level of knowledge and experience in a variety of different technologies and leadership abilities.</p>
					<p>The current skills, qualifications and experience I have accumulated over the years, is inline with progressing towards a similar role, and one day I hope to achieve the capabilities to succeed in such position. By starting my studies at RMIT with the unit Introduction to Technology, I hope to proceed and complete my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. The experience I have gained from my past roles is incredible valuable.&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>My Personal Profile</h2>
				</header>
					<p>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) = <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Defender">Defender</a>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Learning Style Indicator = <a href="Visual.pdf">Visual</a></p>
					<p>Creativity Self-Test Indicator = <a href="Creativity.pdf">61 out of 80</a></p>
					<p>&nbsp;These personal profiling results come as no surprise to me, I 100% agree with the outcomes and their accuracy.</p>
					<p>In a team environment I am generally the quiet one who listens/observes then makes comment and/or then contributes, which is a clear trait of the Defender personality type. Group dynamics and personality types influence a team greatly, by having the right combination of personalities that can be the difference between a high performing cohesive team and/or a team frustrated by others causing conflict.</p>

					<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
				</header>
					<p><strong>Overview</strong>: An app, designed for online children&rsquo;s story book reading, targeted at parents with young children. Similar to an audio book, BUT with the personalisation of the parents being able to record their voice reading the story and also having the story book illustrations for the children to enjoy.<br />The app will allow parents to record their voice reading their favourite stories to their children. Children will be able to interactively learn to read their favourite story books, whilst listening to their parents recorded voice.</p>

					<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: This app would be useful for parents and young children, as parents will have the ability to personalise and connect with their children, whilst the child is accessing the app and listen/reading their favourite online story book. This app development would allow parents to read their children&rsquo;s favourite story on demand for the child. In some cases, parents will not have to read the same book over and over again, as the children will be able to hear the parents voice reading the story, simple by accessing the app, where the parents have pre recorded their voice telling the story. This will free up some time for some parents, and effectively provide some form of comfort to the child who needs their parents to read a book on demand.</p>
					<p>My motivation for this idea has been driven by the personalised experience that the children will gain, by hearing a familiar voice and not a system generated robotic voice telling the story. The children will hear the tone, pitch, accent and mannerism that they are used to hearing from their parents reading the story aloud with book in hand. The apps is designed to help parents.</p>

					<p><strong>Description</strong>:
					<li> Personalised content for an immersive experience &ndash; parents can pre record their voice telling the story just how they would if they were sitting with their child with book in hand.</li>
					<li> A story book can have the option to be read by many e.g., the child could select that they want Mums recording, or Dads recording, or Aunties recording of the story being told.</li>
					<li> Interactive engagement &ndash; as the child grows and learns, the child can turn the digital pages, the child can trace their finger over the words to hear the word being read aloud.</li>
					<li> The app would display the visual illustrations of the book, just as if it were a hardcopy of the story book.</li>
					<li> The app would contain 3 different levels:<br />1. The child would have the story book automatically read start to finish by the parent (child would just listen) <br />2. The child would need to turn the digital pages over, for the story to proceed/following along with the story<br />3. The child would trace their finger over the words to hear and learn to read the story book.</li>
					<li> 1000&rsquo;s of story books available to download for a small monthly fee</li>
					<li> Free month trial when you sign up for a 6-month subscription</li>
					<li> Recordings can be downloaded and saved, great keepsake for children.</li>
					<li> Makes learning experiences fun, interactive and personalised for children</li>
					<li> Compatible for both Android and OS.</li></p>

					<p><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong>
					<p>Software</p>
					<li>Development Kit of choice downloaded&hellip;</li>
					<li>Latest version of Xcode (for creating iOS apps)</li>
					<li>Latest version of JDK (for creating Android apps)</li>
					Hardware
					<li>Modern personal computer &ndash; Windows, Mac or Linux + high quality peripherals</li>
					<li>Network/Internet connection</li>
					<li>iOS and Android devices for testing &ndash; iphone, iPad etc</li></p>

					<p><strong>Skills Required</strong>:
					<li>Developers fluent in Java, Kotlin for Android, and objective-C and Swift for iOS apps</li>
					<li>Developers experienced in data security, problem solving and analytical skills, communications, creativity.</li>
					<li>Development of a mobile application is very feasible, given the popularity of skills required and availability of outsourcing the development.</li></p>

					<p><strong>Outcome</strong>:
					<li>Successful execution of app development will see a standout application from other competitors, providing families with an app they can personalise and enjoy as a family.</li>
					<li>Families will now be able to hear their favourite stories on repeat, freeing up time for parents and assisting children to read.</li></p>
