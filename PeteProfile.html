Currently, I have no employment history in the IT sector but I did complete a certificate III in Network Administration at Adelaide TAFE in 2002.</p><p>I have a keen interest in Information Technology, particularly within the Cybersecurity field. I have a wonderful family with a wife and we have 2 boys both under the age of four that keeps us a bit busy. I have come from a Warehousing and Logistics background (with around 20 years’ experience) and would often work a second job as a Music Teacher (guitar) at a Music school in the evenings.</p><p>Currently, I am working with a large automotive company and I am doing tasks such as servicing/fixing large diesel engines and doing purchasing. When my boys aren’t keeping me busy, I also enjoy playing cricket for my local club in the summer and I enjoy watching motorsport and football.
