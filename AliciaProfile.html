						<h3><strong>PLASSS-tech</strong></h3><br>
				
					<p><br>Student Number: s3886144  <br>
						
			<br> <p> Nationality & Culture: Australian </p>
				
<p>Education to date: Diploma of Information Technology, ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management</p>
<p>Language spoken: English</p>
<p>Interesting fact about me: I never studied anything to do with computers at high school.</p>
 <br> Around the time I finished school and entered the workforce, I suddenly developed a keen interest in IT.
	  I was forced to learn the basics of computing and from there my curiosity continued to grow,
		as did my skill set. To my amazement, I had the ability to pick things up and learn quickly,
		 I soon realised that computers and software were not that difficult to use,
		 this was a real turning point in my developing interest in IT and my education pathway.
Now I have a strong passion for IT, dedicated over 10years working in the field,
and I have operated in many roles where I assist others to develop their skills
 using different technologies in the educational sector.<br>

<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests</strong></h3><br>
				
	<br> <h4> Myer Briggs Test> </h4> <br>
	Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) = Defender
	<br> <h4> Learning Style Test> </h4> <br>
Learning Style Indicator = Visual
<br> <h4> Creativity Self-Test> </h4> <br>
Creativity Self-Test Indicator = 61 out of 80

<br> These personal profiling results come as no surprise to me,
 I 100% agree with the outcomes and their accuracy.
In a team environment I am generally the quiet one who listens/observes then
 makes comments and/or then contributes, which is a clear trait of the Defender personality type.
  Group dynamics and personality types influence a team greatly,
	by having the right combination of personalities that can be the difference between
	a high performing cohesive team and/or a team frustrated by others and causing conflict.<br>

As a visual learner and someone who has a creative strength, I strongly prefer to watch or have something
demonstrated to me when learning something new, and then I like to add my own style and flare, 
when moving forward with either completing the task or showing others.
