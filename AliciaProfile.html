					<p><br>Student Number: s3886144<br>
						
					<p>I am a 37 year old mum of 2 busy children (5 and 3), living in regional NSW. I have qualifications including a Diploma of Information Technology and an ITIL Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management.</p>
					
					<p>My interest in IT developed around the time I finished school and entered the workforce. I was forced to learn the basics of computing and from there my curiosity continued to grow, as did my skill set. To my amazement, I had the ability to pick things up and learn quickly, I soon realised that computers and software were not that difficult to use, this was a real turning point in my developing interest in IT and my education pathway.
					Now I have a strong passion for IT, dedicated over 10years working in the field, and I have operated in many roles where I assist others to develop their skills using different technologies in the educational sector.</p>
					<p>Interesting fact about me: I never studied anything to do with computers at high school.</p>
 
					<p>??</p>
					
					<br><h3><strong>Personality Tests</strong></h3><br>

					<h4> Myer Briggs Test</h4>
					Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) = Defender
						
					<h4>Learning Style Test</h4>
					Learning Style Indicator = Visual
					
					<h4> Creativity Self-Test></h4>
					Creativity Self-Test Indicator = 61 out of 80

					<p>These personal profiling results come as no surprise to me, I 100% agree with the outcomes and their accuracy.
					In a team environment I am generally the quiet one who listens/observes then
					 makes comments and/or then contributes, which is a clear trait of the Defender personality type.
					 Group dynamics and personality types influence a team greatly,
					by having the right combination of personalities that can be the difference between
					a high performing cohesive team and/or a team frustrated by others and causing conflict.<br>

					As a visual learner and someone who has a creative strength, I strongly prefer to watch or have something
					demonstrated to me when learning something new, and then I like to add my own style and flare, 
					when moving forward with either completing the task or showing others.
