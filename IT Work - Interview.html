					The Service Desk I work in only supports internal TAFE NSW staff.

					TAFE NSW’s purpose is to skill the workforce of the future. It is Australia's leading provider of vocational education and training with over 500,000 annual enrolments and a proud history for setting the benchmark for quality service. As the NSW public provider, it supports the NSW Government's priority to grow skills for the economy and jobs of tomorrow. Critically, TAFE NSW plays a vital role in providing vocational education in rural and regional NSW, and job training pathways for the most vulnerable in the community.
					TAFE NSW offers the best of campus-based delivery as well as flexible, online and work-based learning. The TAFE NSW values of Customer First, Collaboration, Integrity and Excellence guide our team in strengthening communities, delivering world-class training for our students and producing job ready graduates for employers. The operating environment for TAFE NSW is dynamic as we leverage our scale, expertise, passion and reputation to meet the rapidly changing VET landscape. TAFE NSW is committed to its students and customers and the role it plays in changing lives and opening up opportunities through learning.</p>
					<p><strong>3.	What other kinds of work do you have to do?<strong>

					<li>	Update all reports / trackers and initiate follow-up action to ensure a professional level of user support and quality customer service is maintained and escalate complex incidents (as required) to solve problems within agreed service levels and standards.
					<li>	Provide knowledgeable technical advice and support to staff using available resources to trouble-shoot system issues and support the efficient use of hardware and software.
					<li>	Collaborate with geographically dispersed teams and provide support across TAFE NSW locations and services which may require a flexible and adaptable approach to working hours and working arrangements.

Taking ownership, monitoring/watching, and following-up the ticket right through to resolution. This best describes the essence of the IT Industry, Service Operations Team that I work in.</p>
