					<p><strong> What Does It Do?</strong><br>
						Cloud computing technology allows users access to storage, files, software,
						 and servers through their own internet-connected devices: computers, laptops,
						 smartphones, tablets, and wearables etc. Cloud computing provides storage and process
						  data in a location that is separate from end users.<br>

<br>Essentially, cloud computing is having the ability to store and access
data and other programs over the internet instead of on a local hard drive.
 This means any sized business can harness powerful IT infrastructure and software
  to become bigger, better, leaner, and more agile, as well as compete with much larger
	companies. Unlike traditional IT hardware and software, cloud computing benefits
	 businesses by having cutting edge technology without having to make large
	  investments in purchasing, maintaining, and servicing equipment themselves.<br>
<br> There are 3 main types of cloud computing.<br>
<ul>
<li>  IaaS:  Infrastructure as a Service
<p>Cloud-based services, such as storage, networking, and virtualization that you pay-as-you-go for. IaaS is hovering around 12% (up from 6%).</p>
<li>  PaaS:  Platform as a Service
<p>Hardware and software tools available over the internet.  PaaS is currently the most prevalent model (32%) and is expected to continue to grow.</p>
<li> SaaS:  Software as a Service
<p>Third-party software that is available over the internet. Approximately 24% of all enterprise workloads utilise SaaS (up from 14% in 2016).</p>
<br>  A cloud server is a virtual server (rather than a physical server) running in
the cloud computing environment. It is built, hosted and delivered via a cloud
computing platform accessed via the internet. A cloud server and can be accessed
 remotely and they are also known as virtual servers. Cloud servers can function
 as independent units and have all the software they require to run.<br>
 <br> The cloud is commonly used to refer to several servers connected
  to the internet that can be leased as part of a software or application service (SaaS).
	Cloud-based services can include data hosting and sharing, web hosting, and application or software use.<br>
	<br>The cloud, also referred to as cloud computing, is where several servers
	are linked together to share the load. This means that instead of exercising
	 one single powerful machine, complex processes can be distributed across multiple smaller computers.
	 The main advantages of cloud storage are that there are numerous distributed resources
	 acting as a single resource, this is often called federated storage clouds.
	  This makes the cloud very resistant to faults, due to the distribution of data.
Using the cloud for sharing data etc can lead to reducing duplication of different
versions of files, due to shared access to documents, files and data.<br>
<br>  Cloud computing will continue to evolve as part of a stack that
 includes the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, or processing at
 the source of data ingestion. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 75 percent of
 enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized
 data center or cloud. In addition, more than 40 percent of organizations’ cloud
  deployment will include edge computing, and 25 percent of endpoint devices will
	execute AI algorithms by 2022, according to IDC.<br>
	<br> By 2022, the top four cloud “megaplatforms” will host 80 percent
	of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) workloads,
	according to IDC. As cloud adoption increases, hybrid and multi-cloud models will become
	 the norm, with every enterprise assembling a mixture of cloud services and legacy applications
	 to meet their needs. Rather than bringing the enterprise to the cloud, this approach
	  brings the cloud to the enterprise. We can expect a world in which cloud computing is
		 the standard and where open, interoperable tools play a crucial role in connecting
		 a company’s data and applications across environments.<br>

		 <br><strong>What is the Likely Impact?</strong>
		 <br> With the predicted rise in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		 companies will now have more access to servers, firewalls, virtual machines,
		  storage, and other infrastructure. Ideal for companies that create highly
			specialized or unique proprietary applications, but don’t have the time to
			 spend on other resources buying, storing, setting up, or maintaining the
			 necessary equipment. Instead, they access ready-to-use infrastructure over the internet.<br>
<br> A cloud server gives the business user stability and security,
 as any software or application problem is isolated from your environment.
  Other cloud servers won’t impact on your cloud server and vice versa.
If the cloud server becomes overloaded by another user, this has
 no impact on your cloud server, unlike with traditional physical servers.<br>
<br> Cloud servers are stable, fast and secure. They don’t have the hardware issues
seen with physical servers, and they are possibly the most stable option for businesses
 wanting to keep their IT budget down.
Cloud servers provide a fast service and are value for money,
as you get more resources and support than you would for a similar
 price of a physical server. A cloud-hosted website will run faster too.
 You get scalability with cloud servers, it is very quick, easy and affordable
 to upgrade, add memory and/or disk space.<br>
 <br>  As it becomes less common to invest in physical hardware
 and IT infrastructure, choosing IaaS alternatives is a safer,
 more reliable option. You don’t need to trust in an external IT contractor,
 as you can access and oversee IaaS platforms yourself (you don’t need to be an IT expert).
IaaS solutions are extremely flexible and scalable, and you can
replace it whenever you need without losing money on your initial investment.
IaaS is beneficial to businesses of all shapes and sizes,
as it allows complete control over your infrastructure,
and operates on a pay-as-you-use model, so it fits affordable into most budgets.
IaaS puts the control and power over the infrastructure back in your hands.<br>

<br><strong>How Will This Affect Us?</strong><br>
<br> Cloud computing is transforming our lives, and in many ways,
 it has a direct impact on our everyday life. We are, as never before,
  seeing cloud technology impact our world on many levels. To reflect on
	the effects of these systemic changes in our lives, some factors are listed below.<br>
	<ul>
	<li> Socially:
	<li> The likes of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google are testimony
		 to a shift in how people are now interacting with others.
<li> It has never been easier now to look for long lost forgotten friends and/or classmates
	 with the explosion of social networks and websites proposing ways to connect and relate
	 through online communities. Facebook is of course a primary example.
<li> Public figures and politicians use social media engines such as Twitter
	 to get an understanding/feel of the community and to convey their views while bearing
	  the pressure and influence from the groups they are looking at leading.

<br><li> Educational:
	<li>  Ability for the students to access data anywhere, anytime, to enrol in
		online classes and to participate in group activities.
<li> The value of combining business automation processes to streamline subscription,
	 class enrolments and assignment tracking, thus reducing expenses significantly.
<li> Ability for the institutional body to leverage the storage cloud to store the daily
	data securely and without the need to cater to a complicated infrastructure.
<li> The benefit of process billing and charging for education and non-education related activities.
<li> Offers benefits to students in developing countries, access to an
	abundance of free websites dispensing educational material and cloud knowledge-sharing
	 communities is now instantly available. A reliable internet connection can be the
	  difference between what we can and can’t access.
