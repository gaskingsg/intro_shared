					<p><strong> What Does It Do?</strong><br>
						Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence – over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale. Typically, you only pay for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change. (Microsoft.com, 2019).<br>
						<br>The state of the art in cloud computing technology allows users access to storage, files, software, and servers through their own internet-connected devices: computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and wearables etc. Cloud computing provides storage and process data in a location that is separate from end users.
This means any sized business can harness powerful IT infrastructure and software to become bigger, better, leaner, and more agile, as well as compete with much larger companies. Unlike with traditional IT hardware and software, cloud computing benefits businesses by having cutting edge technology without having to make large investments in purchasing, maintaining, and servicing equipment themselves.<br>
						
<br>Cloud computing types are service deployment models that let you choose the level of control over your information and the types of services you need to provide. There are three main types of cloud computing services, sometimes called the cloud computing stack because they are built on top of one another. (azure.microsoft.com, n.d.)<br>
<ul>
<li>	The first cloud computing type is infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which is used for Internet-based access to storage and computing power. The most basic category of cloud computing types, IaaS lets you rent IT infrastructure – servers and virtual machines, storage, networks and operating systems – from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. (azure.microsoft.com, n.d.)
<li>	The second cloud computing type is platform as a service (PaaS) that gives developers the tools to build and host web applications. PaaS is designed to give users access to the components they require to quickly develop and operate web or mobile applications over the Internet, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, networks and databases. (azure.microsoft.com, n.d.)
<li>	The third cloud computing type is software as a service (SaaS) which is used for web-based applications. SaaS is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet through which cloud providers host and manage the software applications, making it easier to have the same application on all of your devices at once by accessing it in the cloud. (azure.microsoft.com, n.d.)</li)	
</ul>	
<p><b>By 2022, the top four cloud “megaplatforms” will host 80 percent of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) workloads, according to IDC. As cloud adoption increases, hybrid and multi-cloud models will become the norm, with every enterprise assembling a mixture of cloud services and legacy applications to meet their needs. Rather than bringing the enterprise to the cloud, this approach brings the cloud to the enterprise. We can expect a world in which cloud computing is the standard and where open, interoperable tools play a crucial role in connecting a company’s data and applications across environments. (Future of cloud computing, n.d.)<br>
	
 <br>The future of computing: intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.The intelligent cloud is ubiquitous computing, enabled by the public cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, for every type of intelligent application and system you can envision. The intelligent edge is a continually expanding set of connected systems and devices that gather and analyse data – close to your users, the data or both. Users get real-time insights and experiences, delivered by highly responsive and contextually aware apps. Combine the virtually limitless computing power of the cloud with intelligent and perceptive devices at the edge of your network to create a framework for building immersive and effective business solutions. (Intelligent Edge – Future of cloud computing | Microsoft Azure n.d.)
	
	

		 <p><strong>What is the Likely Impact?</strong>
		 <br>With the predicted rise in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) companies will now have more access to servers, firewalls, virtual machines, storage, and other infrastructure. This is Ideal for companies that create highly specialized or unique proprietary applications, but don’t have the time to spend on other resources buying, storing, setting up, or maintaining the necessary equipment. Instead, they access ready-to-use infrastructure over the internet.</b>
<b>As it becomes less common to invest in physical hardware and IT infrastructure, choosing IaaS alternatives is a safer, more reliable option. You don’t need to trust or invest in an external IT contractor, as you can access and oversee IaaS platforms yourself. Many cloud providers have strict access guidelines to the physical location, multiple forms of authentication and intensive security measures.</b>
<b>IaaS puts the control and power over the infrastructure back in your hands.
IaaS solutions are extremely flexible and scalable, and you can replace it whenever you need without losing money on your initial investment.
IaaS is beneficial to businesses of all shapes and sizes, as it allows complete control over your infrastructure, and operates on a pay-as-you-use model, so it fits affordable into most budgets.</b>

<b>Of course, the cloud is for more than just autonomy, AI and advanced robotics operations. It’s also useful for conventional storage, remote processing, infrastructure as a service, testing and development, analytics, disaster recovery and so much more. So, while autonomy may certainly be responsible for taking a lot of jobs and work opportunities, that doesn’t necessarily mean cloud technologies are, as well. Which brings us full circle to the original question: Is the cloud killing jobs or creating them?
The answer is both. But according to the World Economic Forum, emerging technologies — including the cloud — will help create more jobs by 2022, more than they kill, to be exact. The agency’s report predicts a loss of 75 million jobs by 2022, but also the creation of 133 million jobs during the same period. For anyone who didn’t do the math in their head, that’s a net increase of 58 million jobs. 
Cybersecurity especially will be a highly lucrative opportunity going forward, propelled significantly by the emergence of cloud computing and remote technologies like cloud hosting, which tend to have more vulnerabilities to address than their local or on-site counterparts.

<p><br><strong>How Will This Affect Us?</strong><br>
<br> Cloud computing is transforming our lives, and in many ways,
 it has a direct impact on our everyday life. We are, as never before,
  seeing cloud technology impact our world on many levels. To reflect on
	the effects of these systemic changes in our lives, some factors are listed below.<br>
	<ul>
	<li> Socially:
	<li> The likes of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google are testimony
		 to a shift in how people are now interacting with others.
<li> It has never been easier now to look for long lost forgotten friends and/or classmates
	 with the explosion of social networks and websites proposing ways to connect and relate
	 through online communities. Facebook is of course a primary example.
<li> Public figures and politicians use social media engines such as Twitter
	 to get an understanding/feel of the community and to convey their views while bearing
	  the pressure and influence from the groups they are looking at leading.

<br><li> Educational:
	<li>  Ability for the students to access data anywhere, anytime, to enrol in
		online classes and to participate in group activities.
<li> The value of combining business automation processes to streamline subscription,
	 class enrolments and assignment tracking, thus reducing expenses significantly.
<li> Ability for the institutional body to leverage the storage cloud to store the daily
	data securely and without the need to cater to a complicated infrastructure.
<li> The benefit of process billing and charging for education and non-education related activities.
<li> Offers benefits to students in developing countries, access to an
	abundance of free websites dispensing educational material and cloud knowledge-sharing
	 communities is now instantly available. A reliable internet connection can be the
	  difference between what we can and can’t access.
